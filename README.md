# Work-Day-Schedule
A calendar application that enables users to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## JQuery

I used HTML, CSS and JQuery to create a calendar app that:

1) Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
2) Presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
3) Color-codes each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
4) Allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
5) Enable users to save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
6) Persists events between refreshes of a page
